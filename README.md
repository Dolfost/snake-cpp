## How to install
### Installing dependencies
Game relies on the [newcurses][ncurses] C library, so You have to install it on your machine.
##### Mac OS
If You use MacOS You can install [newcurses][ncurses] with [homebrew][brew] simply by
    
    $ brew install ncurses

##### Unix-like OS
Short ansver: _It depends._  
For examle, if You are using Ubuntu You can install [newcurses][ncurses] by

    $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

If You say _I use Arch btw_ often, You can try

    $ sudo pacman -S ncurses

If You'r distro isn't mentioned here, try to use [google](https://www.google.com):

### Getting the sources
Enter desired directory and run 

    $ git clone https://github.com/Dolfost/snake-cpp
    $ cd snake-cpp

It will create the directory with name `snake-cpp` and enter it. Then You have to compile the game.

### Compiling the game
To build the game You can use `build.sh` script. It is located in the root of git repository. 
To run it, use:

    $ ./build.sh

It will create the game executable `snake.out` and build the help pad for current terminal.

## Running the game
To start the game You can exexute

    $ ./shanke.out

in the git directory root. 

If You are new to the game (probably You are), I recommend You to start game with the `--help` or `-h` option, so You can get used to it.

    $ ./snake.out --help
